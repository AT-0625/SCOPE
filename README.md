# Stellar Catalog & Observation Planning Engine (SCOPE)

**SCOPE** is a Python-based tool for stellar catalog management, observation planning, and data visualization. It allows users to inspect, modify, and filter catalogs, perform visibility checks, and generate plots for astrophysical analysis.

---

## Features

- Load, inspect, and update stellar catalogs through an interactive interface 
- Perform coordinate conversion and observability checks from a chosen Earth location  
- Plan observations using full-night visibility filters based on local time and altitude 
- Generate multiple plot types for catalog structure and observability analysis
- Modular and menu-driven design with robust input validation
- Save outputs as `.csv` tables and `.png/.pdf` plots 

---

## Included files

- `SCOPE.ipynb`: Interactive notebook version for step-by-step execution  
- `SCOPE.py`: Clean Python script version for direct use

---

## Demo CSV Files

This repository includes one demo stellar catalog:

- `SCOPE_StellarCatalog.csv`: Contains data such as Right Ascension, Declination, Apparent Magnitude, Spectral Type, etc.

This file serves as input data for the simulations. Its specific purpose corresponds to the information conveyed by its filename, and the code structure reflects how it is utilized.

## Installation

No special installation required. Just clone the repo and run the script in your Python environment.

---

## Usage

Open `SCOPE.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
Run cells step-by-step.  
Modify inputs as needed.  
Alternatively, run `SCOPE.py` as a script in your local Python setup.
